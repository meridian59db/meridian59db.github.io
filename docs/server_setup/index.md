# Server Setup

Regardless of what type of project you're planning to create, you will need to set up a server core that you can connect your client to in order to log into the game.

Depending on what type of mods you're interested in and whether you're planning to create a publicly hosted private server, selecting a core can be a minor or very serious consideration.
