# Your First: Server Installation

_Disclaimer: This article is written by one of the authors of TSWoW._

Even if you aren't planning on creating any serverside mods for the game, you will still need some kind of server to connect your client to so you can enter the game world.

As discussed under the `cores` section, you have a few options in terms of what emulator to set up depending on what you are planning to do. This list focuses on the **easiest** cores that require little to no technical ability to install.
