# WoTLK Modding Introduction

This is a collection of guides and tutorials for learning how to create mods and custom content for the World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King expansion aimed at people who are completely new to modding.

The WoW modding scene is almost two decades old, and a lot of information is scattered all across the web and with tons of outdated information that can be very confusing to anyone who is completely new.

The aim of this website is to provide up-to-date information about _what wow modding is_, _how to get started_ and _where to find wow modders_. Instead of tutorials to do a bunch of very specific things, these guides will focus on teaching beginners "how to fish" and hopefully inspire a deeper understanding of how the game works, how to develop your own custom features and how to solve problems that may come up.
