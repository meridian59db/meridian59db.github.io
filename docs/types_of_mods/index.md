# Types of Mods

WoW Modding is a very broad practice, and it's easy to feel overwhelmed with the amount of options, tutorials, tools and possibilities that they present.

The aim of this article is to briefly describe the traditional "mod categories" that modders often choose to specialize in. Some modders learn how to do most or even all of these, while others specialize in only a few of them. These include:

- [**Texture Editing**](./texture_edit)
    - _Drawing or editing textures for the game._

- [**Retroporting**](./retroporting)
    - _Porting content from the modern game to older versions._

- [**Model Editing**](./model_edit)
    - _Creating and editing 3D models_

- [**Map Editing**](./map_editing)
    - _Creating and editing the game world and terrain._

- [**Server Programming**](./server_programming)
    - _Reprogramming and scripting open source private server software._

- [**AddOns**](./addon_programming)
    - _Writing the same kind of AddOns used in the normal game to create client interfaces for custom projects._

- [**Data Editing**](./data_editing)
    - _Editing the "data tables" that makes up much of the entities in the game, like spells and creatures._

- [**Reverse Engineering**](./reverse_engineering)
    - _Editing the client exe itself, or documenting the games binary file formats._

- [**Tool Development**](./tool_development)
    - _Developing tools to interact with the data in the game, anything from map editors like _Noggit_, client database editors like _WDBX_ or blender plugins like _WoW Blender Studio_._

- [**Emulation**](./emulation)
    - _Making the game server behave as closely to the blizzard servers as possible._
