# AddOn Programming

Some custom wow projects use AddOns to create custom graphical interfaces for the game, much like how addons are developed for the 'normal' game. AddOns in World of Warcraft are written in `XML` and `Lua`, but some projects also enable writing them in `TypeScript`.

In custom wow projects, AddOn development often has a lot of overlap with serverside scripting and commonly involves using AddOn messages to communicate between the client and the server.

One of the difficulties of client interface development in WoTLK is poor documentation, and often requires learning how to read the code of existing AddOns to figure out how to do various things.
