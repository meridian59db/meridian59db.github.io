# Retroporting

Retroporting is a type of mod that takes content from a more modern versions of the game and "backports" it to earlier versions. Retroporting is not limited to a particular type of mod or version of the game, and can include retroporting maps, 3D models, AddOns/Interfaces or gameplay features such as transmogging or pet battles.

In practice, many retroporters focus on 3D models or maps, and mostly target the Wrath of the Lich King version of the game.

## Skillset

Today, there are many graphical tools to help retroporting models and maps, and it's sometimes possible even for beginners to retroport some models. However, wow formats come with **a lot** of caveats and edge cases that often break the gui tools we have, so some technical proficiency is often necessary to learn how to deal with them.

Beginner retroporters often show proficiency in:

- Knowledge of what client formats exist in the game
- Basic knowledge of WoTLK 3D model formats.
- Editing binary files with ready-made templates
- Problem-solving, because things can easily go wrong.

Expert retroporters often show proficiency in:

- Deep knowledge of wows binary file formats across the different versions of the game
- Hex editing and hex editor scripting ("010 editor")
