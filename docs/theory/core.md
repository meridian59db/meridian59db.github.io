# Core

This article will contain a surface-level explanation and introduction to how the worldserver works and how you can navigate its source code.

It is not meant to be an all-encompassing technical outline, as the worldserver is far too complex to even begin to explain in a single article. Being able to navigate complex source code is an important skill to be able to master the worldserver, but this document might help get beginners started to know where to start looking for the most important parts.

## Code References

The vast majority of these articles should be applicable to any modern core as they are all very similar to each others, but is primarily based on TrinityCore.

Code references will attempt to find function names by text, occasionally links might not work and will require some additional searching. Rarely, function names listed here may become outdated and need updating.

**Note: These code links don't seem to work on firefox, but do work on chrome.**
